# Emotion-Recognition-from-speech
The "Emotion Recognition from Speech" project aims to develop a deep learning model utilizing speech processing techniques to classify emotions in spoken audio. Through neural networks, it distinguishes emotions such as happiness, anger, or sadness from spoken sentences, enhancing understanding of emotional cues in human communication.
